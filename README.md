# minimal

Modified minimal theme for zsh based on zimfw's minimal which is based on subnixr's minimal:

https://github.com/zimfw/minimal

## Changes

- Working directory appears on the left of the prompt
- Git information appears on the lambda prompt
- Enhanced git information (ahead/behind, stash, file status)

## Requirements

Requires Zim's [prompt-pwd] module to show the current working directory, and
[git-info] to show git information.
